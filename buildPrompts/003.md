# Build Step 003: Product Management & Search

## Task Description
Implement item listing (owners) and item discovery (renters) with category filters.

## Discovery
- [schemas/products.md](file:///c:/Users/USER/Documents/dev/nearShare/buildPrompts/schemas/products.md)
- [pages/search_discovery_screen.md](file:///c:/Users/USER/Documents/dev/nearShare/buildPrompts/pages/search_discovery_screen.md)

## PROMPT
Implement the core marketplace functionality:
1. **Listings**: Create a `CreateProductScreen` where owners can upload photos (Firebase Storage) and details (Firestore).
2. **Browsing**: Implement the `SearchDiscoveryScreen`:
   - Display a grid of current listings from Firestore.
   - Add a horizontal list of category chips (e.g., Cameras, Gadgets, Home).
   - Implement a search bar that filters the list locally or via a Firestore query.
3. **Detail View**: Create `ProductDetailScreen` to show full info, owner details, and a "Rent Now" button.

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- User can list a new item with at least one image.
- Home screen displays items dynamically from the database.
- Tapping a category chip filters the displayed items correctly.

## VERIFICATION PROMPT
"Test the listing flow: mock a file upload and verify the Firestore document structure. Test the search filter with various strings and categories."
