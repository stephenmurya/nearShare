# Build Step 005: Risk Mitigation & Admin Dash

## Task Description
Implement the monetary safety net (Security Deposits) and the administrative interface.

## Discovery
- [schemas/security_deposits.md](file:///c:/Users/USER/Documents/dev/nearShare/buildPrompts/schemas/security_deposits.md)
- [pages/admin_dashboard_screen.md](file:///c:/Users/USER/Documents/dev/nearShare/buildPrompts/pages/admin_dashboard_screen.md)

## PROMPT
Finalize the platform's reliability features:
1. **Security Deposit**: 
   - Integrate a payment mock (or Stripe/Razorpay) to collect a deposit before "Rent Now" is confirmed.
   - Create a `SecurityDepositService` to track states: `held`, `refunding`, `forfeited`.
   - Automate refund trigger when the "Return QR" is scanned.
2. **Admin Dash**: Build the `AdminDashboardScreen`:
   - Visual summary of active rentals and total deposits held.
   - A list of reported disputes where an admin can manually release or hold a deposit.
3. **Permissions**: Wrap the Admin Dash route in a secondary check for the `admin` role in the user document.

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- Renter cannot start a rental without "paying" the mock deposit.
- Admin can see a list of all active rentals and user roles.
- Deposit status updates to `refunded` automatically upon return.

## VERIFICATION PROMPT
"Simulate a dispute case: can the admin override the automatic refund? Verify that non-admin users cannot access the admin route via deep-link."
